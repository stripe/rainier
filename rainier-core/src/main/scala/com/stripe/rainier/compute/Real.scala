/*
A Real is a DAG which represents a mathematical function
from 0 or more real-valued input parameters to a single real-valued output.

You can create new single-node DAGs either like `Real(2.0)`, for a constant,
or with `new Variable` to introduce an input parameter. You can create more interesting DAGs
by combining Reals using the standard mathematical operators, eg `(new Variable) + Real(2.0)`
is the function f(x) = x+2, or `(new Variable) * (new Variable).log` is the function f(x,y) = xlog(y).
Every such operation on Real results in a new Real.
Apart from Variable and a simple ternary If expression, all of the subtypes of Real are private to this package.

You can also automatically derive the gradient of a Real with respect to its variables.

Because it is common for ax to have a large number of terms, this is deliberately not a case class,

Unlike for Line, it is not expected that ax will have a large number of terms, and performance will suffer if it does.
Luckily, this aligns well with the demands of numerical stability: if you have to multiply a lot of numbers

[0] For example, of the following four ways of computing the same result, only the first two will have the most efficient
representation:

//#1
(x+y+3).pow(2)

//#2
val z = x+y+3
z*z

//#3
(x+y+3)*(x+y+3)

//#4
(x+y+3)*(y+x+3)

In the second case, because z == z, the multiplication can be collapsed into an exponent. In the third and
fourth cases, although the expressions are equivalent, the objects are not equal, and so this will not happen.
However, in the third case, at the compilation stage the common sub-expressions will still be recognized and so there
will not be any double computation. In the fourth case, because of the reordering, this won't happen, and so
`x+y+3` will be computed twice (in two different orders).
